# Expo Camera Preview Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview fails to render correctly when using certain custom settings. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.  This makes debugging a challenge.

## Bug Description

When using the Expo Camera API with custom settings (flash mode, focus mode, aspect ratio, etc.), the preview sometimes fails to render, resulting in a blank screen or a distorted image. This behavior is not consistent and may occur randomly across different devices and Expo SDK versions. 

## Reproduction Steps

The exact steps to reproduce the bug are not fully understood due to its intermittent nature. However, the provided `bug.js` demonstrates the use of custom camera settings where the problem has been observed.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) involves employing a strategy of checking the camera status more frequently using `useCameraDevicesAsync()` and re-rendering the preview if an error state is detected. This is a workaround because the root cause of the bug remains unknown. Additional strategies might be needed depending on the device and its capabilities.
